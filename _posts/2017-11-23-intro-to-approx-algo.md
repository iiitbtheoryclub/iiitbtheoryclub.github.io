# Talk on Introduction to Approximation Algorithms by [Ananth Murthy](https://www.facebook.com/ananth.murthy.100)

Abstract: This talk will be a brief introduction to approximation algorithms. It will cover what an approximate algorithm/ approximate solution is and when/why this is preferred over an exact solution. It will also briefly contrast approximation algorithms against heuristics. The talk will conclude with an in-depth of analysis of one (or more, depending on time) problem and an approximation algorithm for it.
