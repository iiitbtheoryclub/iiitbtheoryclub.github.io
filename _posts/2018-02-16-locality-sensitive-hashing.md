# Talk on Locality-Sensitive Hashing [Rameshwar Pratap](https://sites.google.com/site/prataprameshwaryadav/)

#### Date: 20th, March, 2018

#### Time: 5:00 pm

#### Venue: Room 134, Old Acad. Block, IIIT-Bangalore

### Abstract:

Recent technological advancements have led to the generation of huge amount of data over the web such as texts, images, audios, and videos. Needless to say that most of these datasets are high dimensional. Searching for similar data-objects in such massive and high dimensional datasets has become a fundamental subroutine in many applications like clustering, classification, nearest neighbours, ranking etc. However, due to the "curse of dimensionality" and scale of the dataset, a brute-force way to compute the similarity scores on such data sets is very expensive and at times impossible. Therefore, it is desired to investigate the algorithms for scalable similarity search.

In this talk, we will discuss the use of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) -- a celebrated result by Indyk and Motwani, STOC 1998 -- for sublinear time similarity search. LSH is a search framework, which works in a two-step way:
1) reducing data dimension, and then
2) grouping similar objects in the same bucket.

We will discuss in detail the LSH for set representation of the dataset, and for Jaccard similarity, which is popularly known as "Minwise-Independent-Permutations" by Broder et al., STOC 1998.
