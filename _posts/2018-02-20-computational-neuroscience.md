# Talk on Computational Neuroscience by [Kumaresh Krishnan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kumaresh-krishnan-bb660bb0/)

Abstract: Amidst of the buzz around artificial intelligence, a humble field that is critical to the advancement of these areas is coming to the fore. The attention turns towards brain-inspired computing, bioengineering and the likes. If we are to create systems that exhibit behaviours similar to human beings, it is cardinal that we have a better understanding of how the human functions. Where best to focus than the brain?! This opens the door to the vast ocean of neuroscience. As computer scientists, our immediate contributions would be in the area of computational neuroscience. What does this field entail? How do we try to unravel the mysteries of the brain? Attend the talk to find out!
