# Question
Imagine $$ n $$ cars, each of which travels at a different maximum speed. Initially, the cars are queued in uniform random order at the starting point of a semi-infinite, one lane highway. Each car drives at the minimum of its maximum speed and the speed at which the car in front of it is driving. The cars will form "clumps". What is the expected number of clumps?

## Source
Will mention after we have received the solutions.
