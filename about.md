The aim of the club is to spread knowledge on various computer science topics for students who are interested in going a step or two further from the regular course work. We would like to focus more on Theoretical Computer Science which covers topics that are highly research oriented and in particular we will be focusing more on theoretical research topics, to name a few like Neural Networks, Geometry, Number Theory, Bitcoins and Block Chains, TCP Routing Algorithms, Cryptography etc. 

Primarily the focus is to discuss in detail about various such topics in groups of interested students. This club is like a hood that will facilitate 'research for fun' where students teach, learn and discuss certain topics amongst their peers.
