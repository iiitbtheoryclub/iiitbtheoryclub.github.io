This is the official page of the IIIT-Bangalore Theory Club.

The aim of the club is to share knowledge on various theoretical computer science topics, particularly mathematical research topics, by going beyond what is taught in class. The topics could be from areas like Machine Learning, Geometry, Number Theory, Crypto currency, Networks, Cryptography, etc. The idea is for students to get a grasp over the mathematics and theory that these computer science areas are rooted in - concepts that may not be possible to cover in a one semester course or elective.

Interested students can volunteer to conduct talks/teaching sessions on a plethora of topics which will be held regularly. There will be discussions, problems and interesting articles/research papers posted on the [Facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/iiitbtheoryclub)
