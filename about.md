The aim of the club is to spread knowledge on various computer science topics for students who are interested in going a step or two further from the regular course work. We would like to focus more on TheoreticalComputer Science which covers topics that are highly research oriented and in particular we will be focusing more on Mathematical Research Topics, to name a few like Neural Networks, Geometry, Number Theory, Bitcoins and Block Chains, TCP routing algorithms, Cryptography etc. 

Though a lot of these topics are covered as courses or research electives, the purpose of this club is to expose it to students who do not know about it, instead of asking them to go through the course. But primarily the focus is to discuss in detail about various such topics in groups of interested students. This club is like a hood that will facilitate what is called as research for fun where students teach, learn and discuss on their topics amongst their peers.


Functioning:

From the unofficial post on Lounge, we got a good response from the students who volunteered themselves to either present on a topic or they wanted a particular topic to be discussed under the club. The functioning will be as follows. There will be regular frequent talks/teaching sessions on various topics for which students will volunteer. Already we got students who volunteered for teaching for around 8 topics. Then these topics will be the broad branches of the clubs. The volunteers will conduct regular meetings with the interested students. There will be discussions on a Facebook page. But the important thing is that each branch is open for all. Everyone is free to enter. Anyone is free to open a new branch if there are sufficient students interested in the topic. And finally, the discussions and sessions will be driven by all the interested students.


In short, we will have regular teaching sessions/knowledge sharing sessions. There will be discussions regarding the topics here. Important results and research papers will be shared on the Facebook page also so that everyone is exposed to the latest research going on in the respective domains. 

Such a club is necessary to exist as many students, though are entering the industry after college, are quite interested in various topics/research areas but are not able to pursue their interest due to lack of exposure and the fear of committing to the same as a credited course.
